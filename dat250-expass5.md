# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 5

Link to Code : 

(for experiment 2 my code is located at exp2/gs-spring-boot/initial)

## Experiment 1:

I followed the turtorial steps, until I encountered an error trying to run the mvnw command on my machine.

I got an error saying my JAVA_HOME enviornment variable was not setup correctly. My enviornment variable was named incorrectly, after giving it the correct name 
the command worked.

Checking that the parameter works.

## Experiment 2:

I chose to clone the git repo instead of using the Spring Initializr. I used the maven project files.

After creating the test and adding the dependency I ran the test
as shown below.

## Experiment 3:

I chose to use the Spring Initializr for this experiment. I created a Maven project.

After creating the Classes Greeting and GreetingController, as detailed in the tutorial. I tested them by running the application with "mvnw spring-boot:run" and getting the expected result from the Test inputs given in the tutorial.

## Experiment 4:

I chose to use the Spring Initializr for this experiment using the template given in the tutorial. I created a Maven project.

After creating the classes Customer and CustomerRepository, and adding the Commandlinerunner to the class with the main method, I ran the application and got the expected output as shown below.

## Technical Problems encountered.

I only encountered one problem which was my JAVA_HOME environment variable was named incorrectly. This was an easy fix, I just needed to name it correctly.

There are no pending issues left to solve.
